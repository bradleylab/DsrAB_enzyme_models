William D. Leavitt, Alexander S. Bradley, André Santos, Inês A.C. Pereira, David T. Johnston.

These files are the R code files used to process the isotope data from enzyme experiments and solve for fractionation factors (alpha) as well as the 33.lambda exponent relating 34S and 33S fractionation. 

Derivation of the equations is given in the supplementary files to the manuscript. 

Questions regarding these files should be addressed to
