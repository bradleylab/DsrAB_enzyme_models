1. Run calculation using measured SO3 and propagate error
2. Run it again using pooled product
-->determine whether error bars overlap

Run a variety of calc's to see how invoking model2 can change the answer that we got from #1-2 above


Solve system for a constant reduced fractionations (at t=0)
Constant oxidized
then constant for both and solve for what would be the d value of a pooled lost residual product


Look at old trithionate Dsr data.. do they also get 0.1875?? Why or why not? is this constant?
This is a problem for mass balance

figure out what conditions would have to occur for this second reaction to happen (e.g. which coincidental reactions)
